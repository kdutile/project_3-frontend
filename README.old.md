Live Link - http://desolate-crag-04367.herokuapp.com/

## DESCRIPTION

My Travel Experiences is an app where users can log their experiences in cities towns, restaurants, museums or any place they might have visited. They can keep track of where they have gone, put a description for what the experience was, where it was located, what was the cost, do they recommend it or not (funtionality on recommendation is limited at the moment or writing this markdown).

Users are required to create a user with username and profile to accesss the site. Once in, they can add logs and they can also see the logs posted by other users. At this moment only a picture for each log will be visible. The user can click on the thumnails for each experience and a more detailed view will appear. It is in this detailed view that the user can click on buttons to edit or delete their own logs.
The user can edit or delete their own logs but not the logs of other users. For the detailed view of other users logs, the users will not see the edit and delete buttons and instead see who is the author of the particular log.
